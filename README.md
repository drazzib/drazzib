# 👋 Hi!

My name is **Damien Raude-Morvan**.

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a **Senior Staff Software Engineer** (_IC5_) at [Decathlon Digital](https://digital.decathlon.net/), passionate about building reliable and performant systems at scale.  
At Decathlon Digital, I support the entire **In Store domain**, providing digital solutions—hardware and software—for 1800+ shops across 75+ countries where Decathlon is present.

My focus areas include:

- 📊 Vendor agnostic Observability
- ⚡ Performance
- 🔧 Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- 🏗️ Global architecture & system thinking

I thrive on solving complex engineering challenges and driving innovation across teams and platforms.

## 🛠️ Skills & Expertise
- Polyglot developer, with deep experience in **Java, Groovy, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript**, and yes... even **PHP**!
- **OpenTelemetry ecosystem**: SDKs, Semantic Conventions (SemConv), Collector
- Distributed systems & cloud-native architecture
- Monitoring, logging, and tracing
- Performance testing & optimization of JVM stacks
- Reliability engineering with circuit breaker, rate limiting, auto-healing

## 🌟 What I’m Working On
Currently, I’m investing much of my time in the **OpenTelemetry ecosystem**—enhancing SDKs, refining semantic conventions, and contributing to the Collector.  
I believe observability is the key to building robust, scalable, and maintainable software.
